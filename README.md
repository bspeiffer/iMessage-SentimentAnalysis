# Exploring iMessage Data

Quick exploration of accessing the iMessage db on macOS

## Files

The [`Juptyer notebook`]
(https://github.com/bspeiffer/iMessag-SentimentAnalysis/blob/main/SentimentAnalysis.ipynb) 
is where the main anaysis was done.

The [`rawquery.sql`]
(https://github.com/bspeiffer/iMessag-SentimentAnalysis/blob/main/rawquery.sql) 
was used as a way to store the queries that I used and iterated on.

The [`message.py`] 
(https://github.com/bspeiffer/iMessag-SentimentAnalysis/blob/main/message.py)
file was used as reference so that I could come up with my own queries.
